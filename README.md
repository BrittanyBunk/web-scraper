# web-scraper
website scraper (i.e. - extractor of info) using python. Note - I didn't create this, but whoever did wants to be anonymous.

The process involves parsing a website before scraping to concentrate the data.

The example website used is the greenlight bookstore's website - https://www.greenlightbookstore.com .

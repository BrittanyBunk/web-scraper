# web-scraper
website scraper (i.e. - extractor of info) using python. Note - I didn't create this, but whoever did wants to be anonymous.

The process involves parsing a website before scraping to concentrate the data.

The example website used is the greenlight bookstore's website - https://www.greenlightbookstore.com .

**There's other ways to scrape sites, but they're potentially subpar:**
- clojure - https://clojure.org/
  * issue - slows down websites
    - python - doesn't do this
      * (?) reason - reads data and moves it elsewhere
        - closure will work with the databases of the website's server itself
- tampermonkey
  * has same issue - as clojure
- url extractor - https://www.prepostseo.com/link-extractor
- git bash - https://gitforwindows.org/

**Subpar IDE's for python:**
- spyder
  * reason - >>clunky
    - reason - >100mb download file
- Wing - https://wingware.com/
  * issue - $
- [online-python.com](https://www.online-python.com/)
  * issue - lacks connectivity - -> call programs, libraries, etc.
    - that would normally be on the comp
      * ex - BeautifulSoup4
 
**supplement - -> IDE:**
- jupyter
  * is a notebook
- colab - https://colab.research.google.com/
  * updater - public
